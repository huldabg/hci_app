what the readme file should consist of:
a) The links to your application files.

b) Brief instructions for installing and using the application. Make sure that a
simple user who is not familiar with your application will be able to read these
instructions to install and use the application. The installation of your application
should be simple, so that a non-specialist can install/use it. If your application
requires additional special steps, e.g. database installation, firewall configuration,
library installation, API installation, etc. a non-specialist user will not be able to
install it.



c) Please indicate the Android SDK version and/or image (e.g. with or without
Google API services) that your application requires. Also any links to the apk, repos,
etc.

d) (Optional) Tell us if and where does the application differ from the prototype of
the second phase?

e) (Optional) A short (up to 3 minutes) video (screen recording with audio)
presenting the application and its features.

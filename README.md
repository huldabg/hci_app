email your README document to hci_lab@ails.ece.ntua.gr or gsiolas@mail.ntua.gr

The final delivery consists of 
1. The application files 
 zip file of the application 
 release apk 
Put both in a cloud repository. You will include the sharing links in the README  document 




what the readme file should consist of:
a) The links to your application files.

b) Brief instructions for installing and using the application. Make sure that a
simple user who is not familiar with your application will be able to read these
instructions to install and use the application. The installation of your application
should be simple, so that a non-specialist can install/use it. If your application
requires additional special steps, e.g. database installation, firewall configuration,
library installation, API installation, etc. a non-specialist user will not be able to
install it.

How to install the application:

How to use the application: If you are hosting the game, click the 'Host a party' button. Then, you can fill in the desired duration of the game and other settings. All players, including the host, must enter the same party code to join the same game. Everyone then answers a few fun fact questions about themselves before the host clicks 'Let's begin!' to start the game. Once started, you will receive a certain amount of 'secret targets' to find. These targets are other players in the same game. The goal is to walk around, talk to people, and try to identify your secret targets before the time runs out. The app serves as a great icebreaker to help you mingle and get to know new people! The player who finds all their secret targets the fastest, using the fewest attempts, wins the game and tops the leaderboard displayed once the game is over.



c) Please indicate the Android SDK version and/or image (e.g. with or without
Google API services) that your application requires. Also any links to the apk, repos,
etc.

in the project standard flutter values ​​are used:
Minimum SDK: API level 21 (Android 5.0)
Target SDK: API level 34 (Android 14)
Compile SDK: API level 34

System Image:
The application requires an Android emulator image with Google APIs. This is necessary because the QR-code scanner and camera integration rely on Google Play Services to function correctly in an emulated environment.

Hardware Requirements:
The application requires Camera Access permission to scan QR codes during gameplay.

d) We made some small changes from the Figma prototype to the final application. We added buttons in the top left corner on many of the screens, so that the player has the ability to return to the previous screen. The textboxes where you fill in, for example, name and interests, have more rounded edges, which gives a softer layout. The transitions between the screens are also different from the Figma prototype. In Figma, the transition were more like turning the page in a book, compared to the finished application where the new screen comes from the middle instead of the side of the old screen. In Figma, the fun facts about your secret target were written on the purple background, but in the finished application, the fun facts are written in the same white textbox as the name and profile picture of your secret target to make is easier to read.

e) (Optional) A short (up to 3 minutes) video (screen recording with audio)
presenting the application and its features.
